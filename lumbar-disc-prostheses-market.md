<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lumbar Disc Prostheses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unrestricted Prosthesis</li><li>Semi-restricted Prosthesis</li><li>Restrictive Prosthesis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lumbar disc prostheses market consists of three main types: unrestricted prostheses, semi-restricted prostheses, and restrictive prostheses. Unrestricted prostheses offer full range of motion and mimic natural disc function, making them ideal for young, active patients. Semi-restricted prostheses allow limited movement, providing stability while still enabling some flexibility, suitable for moderate conditions. Restrictive prostheses, on the other hand, prioritize spinal stability over mobility, often used in severe cases where limit movement is necessary to prevent further injury.</p></p>
