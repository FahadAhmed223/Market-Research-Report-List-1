<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Steel Plates Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HotRolled</li><li>ColdRolled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Galvanized steel plates are steel sheets coated with zinc to prevent rust and corrosion. In the **hot-rolled** market, plates are produced by heating steel above its recrystallization temperature, resulting in a rough surface and lower precision but higher strength. The **cold-rolled** market involves further processing hot-rolled plates at room temperature, yielding smoother, thinner, and more precise sheets with improved surface finish and dimensional accuracy. Both types are widely used in construction, automotive, and manufacturing, with cold-rolled plates often preferred for applications requiring finer finishes.</p></p>
