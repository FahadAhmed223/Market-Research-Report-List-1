<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PERC Solar Panels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mono-crystalline</li><li>Polycrystalline</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PERC (Passivated Emitter Rear Cell) solar panels enhance efficiency by incorporating a rear-passivation layer, increasing light absorption. The market is primarily divided into two types: monocrystalline and polycrystalline. Monocrystalline panels, made from a single crystal structure, offer higher efficiency and better performance in low-light conditions, making them ideal for space-constrained installations. Conversely, polycrystalline panels, created from multiple crystal fragments, are generally less efficient but more cost-effective, appealing to budget-conscious consumers. Both types benefit from the advancements of PERC technology.</p></p>
