<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastics & Polymers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Polymers</li><li>Thermosetting Polymers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The plastics and polymers market is primarily divided into two categories: thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers. Thermoplastic polymers can be reheated and reshaped multiple times without chemical change, making them versatile for applications like packaging and automotive parts. In contrast, thermosetting polymers undergo a chemical change when cured, which makes them rigid and heat-resistant; they can’t be remolded after setting. Both types serve distinct roles across various industries, including construction, electronics, and consumer goods, reflecting their unique properties and applications.</p></p>
