<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neurovascular Stent Retrievers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Expanding Stents</li><li>Self-Expanding Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neurovascular stent retrievers market includes two main types: balloon expanding stents and self-expanding stents. Balloon expanding stents require inflation with a balloon to secure the stent in place, providing precise placement and support to cerebral vessels. In contrast, self-expanding stents automatically expand upon placement, adapting to the vessel’s shape and maintaining patency. Both types are critical for treating conditions like aneurysms or arterial occlusions, enhancing patient outcomes in neurovascular interventions.</p></p>
