<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Adaptive Suspension System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-active Suspension System</li><li>Active Suspension System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive adaptive suspension system market is primarily categorized into two types: semi-active and active suspension systems. Semi-active suspension systems adjust the damping characteristics in response to road conditions, enhancing ride comfort and vehicle stability without changing the spring characteristics. In contrast, active suspension systems use sensors and actuators to dynamically alter both damping and spring settings, providing superior control and comfort by actively responding to driving conditions. Both systems aim to optimize vehicle performance and passenger experience.</p></p>
